What is Smooth Min?
-------------------

It is common to apply the *min* operator to create unions of objects when raymarching distance fields. This is a [CSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) operation implemented in a single line of code, which is a major advantage.

$$\text{min}(a,b) = \begin{cases} a, &\text{if } a < b\\ b, &\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

The *min* operator is a $$C^0$$ function, which means its derivative is not continuous. This is a downside when trying to model organic objects, as can be seen in the following images.

[Inigo Quilez (iq)](http://iquilezles.org/) proposed an operator called [polynomial smooth minimum](http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/smin/smin.htm) that is widely used in [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/). It employs [linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) to blend the two input distance fields. I have used the below code in [some of my shaders](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/vgs) but never had the time to fully comprehend it, so I decided to derive it myself.

{% highlight glsl %}
// Polynomial smooth minimum by iq
float smin(float a, float b, float k) {
  float h = clamp(0.5 + 0.5*(a-b)/k, 0.0, 1.0);
  return mix(a, b, h) - k*h*(1.0-h);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Derivation of the Polynomial Smooth Minimum
-------------------------------------------

The idea is really simple: we should smoothly interpolate the values $$a$$ and $$b$$ if they are near each other, otherwise we return the true maximum. Formally, we define these values to be close if $$a-b \in (\text{-}k,k)$$, in which $$k$$ controls the interpolation range. Therefore, our smooth approximation to *min* should be of the form

$$
\begin{equation}
\text{smin}(a, b, k) =
  \begin{cases}
    a, &\text{if } a - b \geq k \\
    b, &\text{if } a - b \leq \text{-}k \\
    f(a, b, k), &\text{if } a - b \in (\text{-}k, k)
  \end{cases},
\end{equation}
$$

where $$f(a,b,k)$$ is a smooth interpolator. We also want it to be at least $$C^1$$ so that it is visually smooth for our shaders. A first guess for this function would be linear interpolation

$$
\begin{equation}
  f(a,b,k) = a + h(b-a) \quad h \in [0,1],
\end{equation}
$$

in which we compute $$h$$ based on the input values $$a$$ and $$b$$ by remapping the interval $$[-k, k]$$ to $$[0, 1]$$ as such that

$$
  \begin{equation}
  h = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{(a - b)}{2k}.
  \label{eq:h}
  \end{equation}
$$

By plotting *smin* applied to functions $$a = \sin x$$ and $$b = e^{-x}$$ we can notice that it is a reasonable approximation of *min* for small values of $$k$$.

</figure>

The error occurs because of discontinuities in the derivative of $$f(a, b, k)$$ with respect to $$x$$, which is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{da}{dx} + \frac{dh}{dx}(b - a) + h\left(\frac{db}{dx} - \frac{da}{dx}\right).
  \tag{1}
  \label{eq:derivative}
\end{equation}
$$

Let us analyze what happens at the boundaries of $$(\text{-}k, k)$$. If $$a-b=-k$$ then $$h = 0$$ and the above equation reduces to

$$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{da}{dx} + k\frac{dh}{dx}.
  \tag{2}
  \label{eq:reduce-1}
\end{equation}
$$

Otherwise, if $$a-b=k$$ then $$h = 1$$ and we have

$$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{db}{dx} - k\frac{dh}{dx}.
  \tag{3}
  \label{eq:reduce-2}
\end{equation}
$$

We respectively want equations ($$\ref{eq:reduce-1}$$) and ($$\ref{eq:reduce-2}$$) to be $$\frac{da}{dx}$$ and $$\frac{db}{dx}$$, so that the derivative of $$f(a, b, k)$$ matches the ones for $$a$$ and $$b$$ at the limits of interval $$[\text{-}k, k]$$. In other words, we want to get rid of the second term in each of these equations.

We can start by adding $$-k\frac{dh}{dx}$$ into the right-hand side of $$(\ref{eq:derivative})$$ so as to cancel out the second term in $$(\ref{eq:reduce-1})$$. However, this changes the second term of $$(\ref{eq:reduce-2})$$ to be $$-2k\frac{dh}{dx}$$. Hence, we need to add $$2kh\frac{dh}{dx}$$ into the right-hand side of $$(\ref{eq:derivative})$$. This new term is zero in $$(\ref{eq:reduce-1})$$ because $$h=0$$ in the former, and it cancels out the prior $$-2k\frac{dh}{dx}$$ in $$(\ref{eq:reduce-2})$$ as $$h=1$$ in the latter. Therefore, the corrected derivative of $$f(a,b,k)$$ must be

$$
  \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{da}{dx}
                + \frac{dh}{dx}(b - a) + h\left(\frac{db}{dx} - \frac{da}{dx}\right)
                - k\frac{dh}{dx} + 2kh\frac{dh}{dx}.
$$

By integrating the above equation, rearranging its terms, and using GLSL notation, we can conclude that

$$
  \begin{align}
  f(a, b, k) &= a + h(b - a) - kh + kh^2 \\
             &= a(1-h) + hb - kh(1 - h) \\
             &= \text{mix}(a, b, h) - kh(1 - h).
  \end{align}
$$

There is probably a simpler way around this derivation. Nevertheless, I think this exercise has been really interesting to me, and I hope for you as well. Thank you for reading!

**Update:** At the time this post was published, Inigo Quilez had provided the operator without explaining it. You can now read [his own description](http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/smin/smin.htm).
