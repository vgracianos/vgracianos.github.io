I did a lot of bug fixing in legacy code that uses the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/), and I noticed an odd pattern being used for moving [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html) towards a target position.

```csharp
transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, targetPosition, Time.deltaTime);
```

The code makes the object start moving at a high speed while smoothly decelerating until reaching the target. The movement is interesting and many Unity developers seem to like it, even though [some of them](https://forum.unity.com/threads/for-the-noobs-Lerp-tutorial-point-a-to-b-animation.56143/) [do not completely understand](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/149103/why-use-time-deltatime-in-Lerping-functions) [why it works](https://answers.unity.com/questions/14288/can-someone-explain-how-using-timedeltatime-as-t-i.html). It is even used in the [official tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-mXwSCvWc) of ```Vector3.Lerp```. Despite its simplicity, this line of code has some issues.

+ **The intent is not clear**: the code seems to be doing a proper linear interpolation, but the resulting movement is nonlinear.
+ **Framerate dependency**: if a machine can run the game loop faster, then it will reach the target position in less time.
+ **Reliance on floating-point error**: the target is only reached because of precision loss in floating-point arithmetic.

Fortunately, the solution to these problems is simple: the value of the third parameter must be adjusted using a power function based on ```Time.deltaTime``` and a constant `epsilon`, which specifies an acceptable radius for reaching the target.

```csharp
float t = 1.0f - Mathf.Pow(epsilon, Time.deltaTime);
transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, targetPosition, t);
```

The following  sections explain why this is a proper solution by exploring the mathematics of this particular usage of ```Vector3.Lerp```, which is known as [exponential smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing).

Linear Interpolation and Exponential Smoothing
----------------------------------------------

```Vector3.Lerp``` computes a linear interpolation between two vectors $$\mathbf{A}$$ and $$\mathbf{B}$$ and can be described as

$$\mathit{Lerp}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, t) = (1 - t)\mathbf{A} + t \mathbf{B}, \quad t \in [0,1].$$

Exponential smoothing consists in consecutive applications of *Lerp* in a recursive fashion. For instance, by defining $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ as the i-th iteration of *Lerp*, the sequence

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{p}_1 &= \mathit{Lerp}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, t)\\
\mathbf{p}_2 &= \mathit{Lerp}(\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{B}, t)\\
\mathbf{p}_3 &= \mathit{Lerp}(\mathbf{p}_2, \mathbf{B}, t)\\
&\vdots\\
\mathbf{p}_n &= \mathit{Lerp}(\mathbf{p}_{n-1}, \mathbf{B}, t)\\
\end{align*}
$$

represents these consecutive, recursive applications. A natural question arises: what is the value of $$\mathbf{p}_n$$? We can answer by expanding the sequence as follows.

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{p}_1 &= (1-t) \mathbf{A} + t \mathbf{B}  \\
\mathbf{p}_2 &= (1-t)^2 \mathbf{A} + (1-t)t \mathbf{B} + t \mathbf{B}  \\
\mathbf{p}_3 &= (1-t)^3 \mathbf{A} + (1-t)^2t \mathbf{B} + (1-t)t \mathbf{B} + t \mathbf{B}  \\
 \vdots&  \\
\mathbf{p}_n &= (1-t)^n \mathbf{A} + \left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)^i\right] t \mathbf{B}
\end{align*}
$$

The above summation is a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) whose solution is

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)^i = \frac{1 - (1-t)^n}{t},
$$

which, assuming $$t \neq 0$$, let us write a direct formula for the n-th iteration as

$$
\mathbf{p}_n = (1-t)^n \mathbf{A} + (1 - (1-t)^n) \mathbf{B}.
$$

By defining $$u = 1 - t$$, the equation can be simplified to

$$
\mathbf{p}_n = u^n \mathbf{A} + (1 - u^n) \mathbf{B}.
$$

Notice how the formula resembles linear interpolation, but instead of using linear blending functions $$t$$ and $$(1-t)$$, we use exponential blending functions $$(1-u^n)$$ and $$u^n$$. This is why the technique is called *exponential smoothing*.

Zeno's Paradox
--------------

We can rewrite $$\mathbf{p}_n$$ in terms of a single exponential function as

$$
\mathbf{p}_n = \mathbf{B} + u^n (\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}),
$$

which makes it clear that $$\mathbf{B}$$ is reached as $$u^n$$ approaches zero. If we take $$u=0.5$$ then the first five elements of the sequence are

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{p}_1 &= \mathbf{B} + 0.5^1(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) = 0.5\mathbf{A} + 0.5\mathbf{B}\\
\mathbf{p}_2 &= \mathbf{B} + 0.5^2(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) = 0.25\mathbf{A} + 0.75\mathbf{B}\\
\mathbf{p}_3 &= \mathbf{B} + 0.5^3(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) = 0.125\mathbf{A} + 0.875\mathbf{B}\\
\mathbf{p}_4 &= \mathbf{B} + 0.5^4(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) = 0.0625\mathbf{A} + 0.9375\mathbf{B}\\
\mathbf{p}_5 &= \mathbf{B} + 0.5^5(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) = 0.03125\mathbf{A} + 0.96875\mathbf{B}.
\end{align*}
$$

The sequence quickly converges towards the target point but at an ever slowing pace. In fact, we will only reach $$\mathbf{B}$$ after infinitely many iterations. This pattern is one of the three [paradoxes of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes) by Zeno, a greek philosopher and mathematician.

Framerate Independence
----------------------

To control the movement speed, we need to command the rate at which $$u^n$$ approaches zero. Also, we want it to be consistent across different framerates.

Let $$\epsilon$$ be the radius of a small sphere centered at the target. When the sphere is reached we will instead assume that the target is reached up to an error bound $$\epsilon$$. Naturally, we should seek a value $$u$$ so that after $$n$$ iterations $$u^n$$ is exactly $$\epsilon$$. This can be done by setting $$u = \sqrt[n]{\epsilon}$$ (hence $$t = 1 - \sqrt[n]{\epsilon})$$.

The plot below displays the behaviour of exponential smoothing given $$\epsilon = 0.5$$ and $$n = 30$$. As it can be seen, $$\epsilon$$ is reached at 30 iterations, $$\epsilon^2$$ at 60 iterations, and so on. This means that if your game is running at 30 FPS, then half the distance between $$\mathbf{A}$$ and $$\mathbf{B}$$ will be reached in one second, a quarter in two seconds, and so on.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/blog/expsmooth/plot.png" %}

Now suppose that your game is running at 60 FPS, and you are using the same values for $$n$$ and $$\epsilon$$. Now, half the distance will be reached in a half second. This is inconsistent when compared to the same game running at 30 FPS. In order to correct the issue you must set $$n = 60$$. In the general case, $$n$$ should be set to the current FPS at which your game is running.

In the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/), we can approximate the current FPS by using the [delta time](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html) between frames, which means that we can simply set $$n = \frac{1}{\Delta T}$$. This inverse relation is interesting because it turns the n-th square root in $$t = 1 - \sqrt[n]{\epsilon}$$ into the n-th power

$$t = 1 - \epsilon^{\Delta T}.$$

The final code is just a translation of the above formula, as already presented in the first section.

```csharp
float t = 1.0f - Mathf.Pow(epsilon, Time.deltaTime);
transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, targetPosition, t);
```
