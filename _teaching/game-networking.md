## About

This course gives students an overall view of computer networks focusing on game programming applications. It introduces them to the OSI and TCP/IP models by presenting the respective algorithms and protocol suites. Topics such as digital modulation, multiplexing, error detection and correction, routing algorithms, congestion control, client-server models, authoritative servers, and others are discussed throughout the course. Students learn to program networked games by using Unity 3D, and socket programming is also introduced.
