## About

This course gives students an overall view of computer graphics focusing on real-time rendering techniques. It introduces them to the rendering pipeline, bidimensional and tridimensional transformations, model representations (curves, surfaces, meshes, voxels), basic radiometric and local/global illumination concepts, and texture mapping. The course also establishes the foundations of shader programming using [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com).
