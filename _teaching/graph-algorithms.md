## About

This course gives students a theoretical and practical introduction to graph algorithms. Basic graph theory definitions, theorems, and principles are presented to students so that they can develop a complete understanding of the most widely known graph algorithms for particular problems such as shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, maximum flow, among others. During the course, students must implement some of these algorithms and apply them into toy problems, whose specifications are mostly based on online judges such as [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/) or [SPOJ](http://br.spoj.com/).
