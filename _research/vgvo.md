Abstract
--------

This paper presents a novel approach to swarm navigation that combines
hierarchical abstractions, flocking behaviors, and an efficient
collision avoidance mechanism. Our main objective is to keep large
groups of robots segregated while safely navigating in a shared
environment. For this, we propose the Virtual Group Velocity Obstacle,
which is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept for groups of
robots. By augmenting velocity obstacles with flocking behaviors and
hierarchical abstractions, we are able to navigate robotic swarms in a
cohesive and smooth fashion. A series of simulations and real
experimentswere performed and the results show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.
