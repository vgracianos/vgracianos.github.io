Abstract
--------

The use of large groups of robots in the execution of complex tasks
has received much attention in recent years. Generally called robotic
swarms, these systems employ a large number of simple agents to
perform different types of tasks. A basic requirement for most robotic
swarms is the ability for safe navigation in shared
environments. Particularly, two desired behaviors are to keep robots
close to their kin and to avoid merging with distinct groups. These
are respectively called cohesion and segregation, which are observed
in several biological systems. In this paper, we investigate two
different approaches that allow swarms of robots to navigate in a
cohesive fashion while being segregated from other groups of
agents. Our first approach is based on artificial potential fields and
hierarchical abstractions. However, this method has one drawback: It
needs a central entity which is able to communicate with all
robots. To cope with this problem, we introduce a distributed
mechanism that combines hierarchical abstractions, flocking behaviors,
and an efficient collision avoidance mechanism. We perform simulated
and real experiments to study the feasibility and effectiveness of our
methods. Results show that both approaches ensure cohesion and
segregation during swarm navigation.
