Abstract
--------

Safe and efficient navigation of robotic swarms is an important
research problem. One of the main challenges in this area is to avoid
congestion, which usually happens when large groups of robots share
the same environment. In this paper, we propose the use of
hierarchical abstractions in conjunction with simple traffic control
rules based on virtual forces to avoid congestion in swarm
navigation. We perform simulated and real experiments in order to
study the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm. Results show that our approach allows the swarm to navigate
without congestions in a smooth and coherent fashion, being suitable
for large groups of robots.
