Abstract
--------

A robotic swarm consists of a system formed by multiple robots that
usually work cooperatively to perform a certain task. One important
research topic in this area is navigation. Traditional approaches use
planners that exploit the individual configuration space of each
agent, generally causing problems in group behavior, such as lack of
consistency and traffic congestions. This paper aims to formulate a
hierarchical abstraction that controls the swarm, defining a geometric
formation of known properties that allows automated control of group
consistency. Thus, it is possible to solve the path planning problem
from the exploitation of its configuration space, which is independent
of the number of robots. We perform simulated and real experiments in
order to evaluate the proposed approach. Results show that the
abstraction is effective to define the group formation as well as
increase its coherence during navigation.
